    "### Adding visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've built a model, run it, and analyzed some output afterwards. However, one of the advantages of agent-based models is that we can often watch them run step by step, potentially spotting unexpected patterns, behaviors or bugs, or developing new intuitions, hypotheses, or insights. Other times, watching a model run can explain it to an unfamiliar audience better than static explanations. Like many ABM frameworks, Mesa allows you to create an interactive visualization of the model. In this section we'll walk through creating a visualization using built-in components, and (for advanced users) how to create a new visualization element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note for Jupyter users: Due to conflicts with the tornado server Mesa uses and Jupyter, the interactive browser of your model will load but likely not work. This will require you to use run the code from .py files. The Mesa development team is working to develop a** [Jupyter compatible interface](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/issues/1363).**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a quick explanation of how Mesa's interactive visualization works. Visualization is done in a browser window, using JavaScript to draw the different things being visualized at each step of the model. To do this, Mesa launches a small web server, which runs the model, turns each step into a JSON object (essentially, structured plain text) and sends those steps to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "A visualization is built up of a few different modules: for example, a module for drawing agents on a grid, and another one for drawing a chart of some variable. Each module has a Python part, which runs on the server and turns a model state into JSON data; and a JavaScript side, which takes that JSON data and draws it in the browser window. Mesa comes with a few modules built in, and let you add your own as well."

    "To start with, let's have a visualization where we can watch the agents moving around the grid. For this, you will need to put your model code in a separate Python source file; for example, `MoneyModel.py`. Next, either in the same file or in a new one (e.g. `MoneyModel_Viz.py`) import the server class and the Canvas Grid class (so-called because it uses HTML5 canvas to draw a grid). If you're in a new file, you'll also need to import the actual model object."

The only thing we need to provide is a function which takes an agent, and returns a portrayal object. Here's the simplest one: it'll draw each agent as a red, filled circle which fills half of each cell."

Note that both of these are class variables, not object variables -- they hold for all particular objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, look at the `__init__` method. It takes three arguments: the number of bins, and the width and height for the histogram. It then uses these values to populate the `js_code` property; this is code that the server will insert into the visualization page, which will run when the page loads. In this case, it creates a new HistogramModule (the class we created in JavaScript in the step above) with the desired bins, width and height; it then appends  (`push`es) this object to `elements`, the list of visualization elements that the visualization page itself maintains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the last thing we need is the `render` method. If we were making a general-purpose visualization module we'd want this to be more general, but in this case we can hard-code it to our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "class HistogramModule(VisualizationElement):\n",
    "    # ... Everything from above...\n",
    "\n",
    "    def render(self, model):\n",
    "        wealth_vals = [agent.wealth for agent in model.schedule.agents]\n",
    "        hist = np.histogram(wealth_vals, bins=self.bins)[0]\n",
    "        return [int(x) for x in hist]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time the render method is called (with a model object as the argument) it uses numpy to generate counts of agents with each wealth value in the bins, and then returns a list of these values. Note that the `render` method doesn't return a JSON string -- just an object that can be turned into JSON, in this case a Python list (with Python integers as the values; the `json` library doesn't like dealing with numpy's integer type).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can create your new HistogramModule and add it to the server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    histogram = mesa.visualization.HistogramModule(list(range(10)), 200, 500)\n",
    "    server = mesa.visualization.ModularServer(MoneyModel, \n",
    "                           [grid, histogram, chart], \n",
    "                           \"Money Model\", \n",
    "                           {\"N\":100, \"width\":10, \"height\":10})\n",
    "    server.launch()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run this code, and you should see your brand-new histogram added to the visualization and updating along with the model!\n",
    "\n",
    "![Histogram Visualization](files/viz_histogram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've felt comfortable with this section, it might be instructive to read the code for the [ModularServer](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/visualization/ModularVisualization.py#L259) and the [modular_template](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/visualization/templates/modular_template.html) to get a better idea of how all the pieces fit together."
